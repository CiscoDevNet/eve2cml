# TODOs

### Device mapper
- take the device mapping from package data as YAML and import it at program start instead of including it in code
- allow to export this data to provide a starting point / sample to customize
- allow to import this data at program start to allow for custom mappings

### Configuration sets
- need to provide a command line flag to specify which config set, if present, should be included in the resulting CML YAML file
- alternatively, if config sets are present, write multiple files, one for each config set

## Done

### General file handling
- allow for files to be present in ZIP format
- unpack content in ZIP file and convert each file in the ZIP
